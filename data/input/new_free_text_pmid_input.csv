PMID36878902,"The proband was a male born at term with respiratory failure. Soon thereafter, he developed bilateral pneumothoraces and was noted to have suprasystemic pulmonary hypertension with right-to-left flow across a large patent ductus arteriosus. He was initially treated with inhaled nitric oxide and later transitioned to oral sildenafil. By age 3?months, he was weaned off mechanical ventilation when an echocardiogram showed right ventricular pressure less than half of systemic pressure. He was discharged home, self-ventilating on room air with no requirement for pulmonary hypertension medications. At age 15?months the proband returned for follow-up and was noted to be intermittently tachypneic. Echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization showed pulmonary hypertension, and sildenafil was reinitiated. A chest CT showed a paucity of lung markings and perihilar peribronchial wall thickening. Over the subsequent 2?years, his lung disease progressed, with a 4?L oxygen requirement and moderate pulmonary hypertension treated with tadalafil and bosentan.

The family history revealed a father, aunt, and grandfather in the paternal lineage with multiple head and neck paragangliomas. At the age of 19, both CBTs were surgically removed. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral paraganglioma. Three years after surgery, the patient noticed recurrence of the swelling in the neck on the right, and at the age of 27, recurrence of the right CBT was diagnosed with MR imaging (Figure 1). In addition, the MRI showed bilateral vagal paragangliomas with the left-sided tumor slowly progressive over time. In the following years, paresis of the right vocal cord developed, accompanied by hoarseness that was acceptable for the patient. At the age of 34, the patient was diagnosed with an additional jugulotympanic paraganglioma on the left side, which was partly surgically removed 16?years later because of troublesome pulsatile tinnitus.

PMID37396576,"The proband was a 14-year-old female who presented with a two-year history of reduced tolerance to physical exertion and subsequently experienced severe dyspnea, respiratory distress, and fatigue following exertion. The patient suffered a sudden cardiac arrest 2?h before arrival at the hospital, during which carotid pulsation and respiratory movement were absent. CPR and defibrillation were promptly administered by first-aid personnel, resulting in the return of heartbeats after 15?min and restoration of sinus rhythm. Nevertheless, the patient remained unconscious and exhibited no spontaneous breathing. The patient was transferred to the emergency department while receiving laryngeal mask ventilation and subsequently underwent tracheal intubation, positive pressure ventilation, fluid infusion, sedation, and analgesia. The patient was later transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit one hour after the cardiac arrest. The patient's parents denied any history of illness, especially cardiovascular disorders, and any family history of cardiac arrest or cardiovascular disease. Notably, no family member had a history of hypertension or coronary artery disease. Upon arrival at the cardiac intensive care unit, the patient's blood pressure was approximately 92/63?mmHg, and arterial oxygen saturation was maintained at 97% through mechanical ventilation. Physical examination revealed the patient to be comatose with significant cardiac enlargement, thoracolumbar scoliosis, and muscle weakness. The electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed right axis deviation, biventricular hypertrophy, and ventricular escape beats. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed significant hypertrophy of the left ventricular wall, particularly the interventricular septum (IVS) and left posterior ventricular wall (LVPW). In addition, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) demonstrated diffuse hypertrophy of the ventricular myocardium. Furthermore, the T2-weighted image revealed an abnormal signal intensity of the left ventricular subendocardial myocardium indicating myocardial ischemia. ",ALPK3,0
PMID38317675,"A full-term male infant was referred at 4 months of age for ��jittery�� movements of limbs and poor feeding. Antenatal, perinatal and neonatal course prior to presentation were unremarkable and developmental milestones were appropriate. Neurological and systems examination, apart from mild intermittent peripheral increased tone, were otherwise normal. Head circumference was 41 cm (25th centile). Initial baseline biochemistry and metabolic screen, and cranial ultrasound were normal. At age 5 months he developed episodes of extensor posturing. A CT and MRI brain showed benign increased extra-axial CSF spaces, but no other abnormality. The jittery movements persisted, and by nine months he had experienced developmental regression across all domains; no longer able to sit, move on all fours or pull to stand, nor reaching for objects. He stopped smiling socially, could only fix on objects briefly and exhibited nonspecific babbles. He was also noted to have jittery head and hand movements, and paroxysms of trunk stiffening as well as staring. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed an active epileptic encephalopathy characterised by generalised (bi-synchronous) high amplitude sharp waves, almost continuous at times, with periods of marked background attenuation and electro-decrement during sleep. He had short generalised tonic seizures, as well as generalised epileptic spasms. By the age of 2 years, seizure activity was largely characterised by generalised tonic seizures, atonic seizures and epileptic spasms, refractory to multiple therapies (including corticosteroids, sodium valproate, clobazam, ACTH, vigabatrin, levetiracetam, lamotrigine, topiramate, rufinamide, phenobarbitone, and the ketogenic diet). The early-onset involuntary jittery movements of head and arms progressed to a mixed hyperkinetic movement disorder. During wakefulness he became restless (with leg kicking, arms waving about), developed stereotypies (headbanging, rocking, teeth grinding, tongue protrusion), gratification, and choreoathetosis involving head, arms, and legs (sometimes ballistic), unrelated to seizure activity, and dissipating in sleep. A vagal nerve stimulator (VNS) was inserted at 5 years of age, which reduced motor seizures and frequency of status epilepticus. Currently, at age 15 years he is treated with multiple ASMs (sodium valproate, phenobarbitone, nitrazepam), with ongoing daily seizures (tonic, tonic-clonic, atypical absences). At age 15 years, the hyperkinetic movement disorder is prominent and includes choreoathetosis of limbs, head, as well as oro-lingual dyskinesia, with episodes of agitation, and discomfort requiring oral clonidine. He is profoundly neurologically impaired, non-verbal and non-ambulant. Earlier childhood was also complicated by recurrent otitis media, scoliosis, gastrostomy and precocious puberty.",ANKRD1,0
PMID37800809,"The study reported a 1-month-old female proband with Han nationality whose non-consanguineous parents were healthy with no family history of genetic disorders or contagious diseases. She was the first birth from the 23-year-old mother, who was diagnosed as gestational hypertension at 5 months�� gestation. During pregnancy, 2 tests for Down��s syndrome suggested high potential risk, in contrast to the results of noninvasive prenatal testing that indicated no abnormalities in the fetus. At 31?+?2 weeks�� gestation, an emergency cesarean section was performed in People��s Hospital of Yuncheng County due to severe preeclampsia, severe placental abruption with a separation area of 4/5, and slow fetal heart rate. Neonatal physical examination recorded a birth weight of 1.18?kg and a heart rate of 70 bpm, together with birth asphyxia, bluish discoloration on the skin, flaccid limbs, and unresponsiveness. Medical intervention was carried out immediately, including warmth keeping, airway clearing, and 30 seconds of positive pressure ventilation using resuscitation device. The subsequent examination revealed improved muscular tone, with the heart rate recorded as >100 bpm and 1-minute Apgar score rated as 5. But crying was still not observed in this newborn. No abnormalities were detected in amniotic fluid and umbilical cord. Blood tests indicated significantly increased procalcitonin (100?ng/mL) as well as relatively low platelet count (124?��?109/L) accompanied by coagulation dysfunction as demonstrated by difficulty in stopping the bleeding on the puncture sites. The brain sonography on day 4 after birth showed brain injury and intracranial hemorrhage. Therefore, 140?mg of bovine lung surfactant was administered through endotracheal intubation in addition to ventilator-assisted ventilation. Antibiotic treatment was also given till the inflammatory indicators of the infant returned to normal levels. During the hospitalization, recurrent fever was noted 4 times during 1 month, accompanied by elevated levels of white blood cells, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin. Besides, 2 apnea episodes were also observed within 27 days. The immature infant was malnourished with poor response and tachypnea. The inspection revealed less ruddy skin with an uneven texture, and scattered petechiae on the limbs caused by venipuncture. The anterior fontanel, which remained unclosed, measured about 2 cm?��?2?cm. Perioral cyanosis and the congestion in pharyngeal mucosa were also noted in the examination. Retraction sign of 3 fossae was negative. Pulmonary auscultation suggested coarse breathing sounds in bilateral lungs without rhonchi or moist rales. A stable heart rate of 160 bpm along with strong cardiac sounds was registered, with no murmurs heard in any of the auscultatory valve areas. Abdominal palpation indicated abdominal distension and mild muscular hypertonicity. The abdominal circumference was measured as 27?cm. Abdominal compression did not elicit crying or painful expressions. No mass was spotted in abdominal palpation, by which the liver and spleen were also not touched. The bowel sounds were 3 times/min. Examination of the fingers suggested normal capillary filling time and nail-bed pallor but with no cyanosis. No abnormality was found in muscle tone test of the extremities. The clinical diagnosis was eventually confirmed as neonatal sepsis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Repeated blood routine tests all showed increased leukocyte levels beyond the upper limit of normal range, with the highest recorded as 28.67?��?109/L, which was mainly attributed to elevated counts of lymphocytes. The results also revealed lifted C-reactive protein levels as high as 46.50?mg/L and lowered platelet counts down to 45?��?109/L. The infant suffered sustained anemia, as demonstrated by declined erythrocyte counts as low as 2.79?��?1012/L and the decrease in hemoglobin with a minimum value of 75?g/L. Bone marrow smears suggested significantly active bone marrow hyperplasia, with lymphocytes accounting for 48%, juvenile lymphocytes for 2.5%, granulocytes for 30%, and erythrocytes for 21%. In the myelogramme, all stages of granulocytes were coexisted, with a higher ratio of neutrophilic myelocytes observed, while polychromatic and orthochromatic normoblasts were predominant in erythrocytic series. Besides, no anomaly was detected pertaining to the thyroid function, as well as the levels of immunoglobulin, antinuclear antibody, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and urinary calcium/creatinine ratio. The following-up of 1-year-6-month showed that the language, motion and height of development is slight falling behind the children of the same age.",ANKRD1,0

PMID37485122,"A 29-year-old, gravida 4, booked mother delivered a female baby vaginally at 40 weeks and one day of gestation at our institute. The mother��s first pregnancy was medically terminated at 20 weeks of gestation in view of a large para-midline anechoic supratentorial cyst in the fetus. Her second pregnancy resulted in a live healthy male baby, while the third pregnancy resulted in a blighted ovum followed by an abortion at one and a half months of amenorrhea. The current pregnancy was booked, and on a level 2 scan, the fetus was found to have an anechoic lesion in the brain which was investigated further with a fetal MRI. MRI revealed isolated ACC. She did not have a history suggestive of an intrauterine infection, and her TORCH screening was negative. The mother��s blood group was O Rh-negative, not iso-immunized, and she received anti-D immunoglobulin. The rest of the antenatal period was uneventful, and all antenatal visits were completed. The mother had partial ACC, with a history of seizure disorder controlled on a single antiepileptic between 1996 and 2008 with no requirement of any antiepileptic for the last 13 years. The neonate cried immediately after birth. The APGAR score was 8 and 9 at one and five minutes, respectively. The neonate received routine care at birth. The birth weight was 2,940 g which was appropriate for gestational age per the Intergrowth-21 newborn size at birth charts. Length and head circumference was 48 cm and 33.5 cm, respectively, both between the 10th and 50th centile per the Intergrowth-21 size at birth charts. General physical and neurological examinations at birth were normal, and the neonate was initiated on breastfeeding. A detailed workup for antenatally diagnosed ACC was done. An ophthalmological examination was done to rule out chorioretinal lacunae without any significant findings. Her TORCH screening was negative. Ultrasound of the cranium revealed an absence of the corpus callosum, colpocephaly, and a subependymal cyst in the left caudothalamic groove without any features of hydrocephalus. Ultrasound of the abdomen, kidney, and urinary bladder was normal. Echocardiography revealed a 5 mm atrial septal defect. Automated brainstem evoked response audiometry was normal bilaterally and so was the infantogram. MRI revealed an absence of the corpus callosum with colpocephaly and a characteristic Viking helmet appearance. ",ARX,0
PMID36816814,"The patient is the second of three children of a nonconsanguineous couple. The 70-year-old mother and two brothers are healthy. From the age of 50, the father suffered from a progressive neurological condition of unknown cause characterized by ataxia, dysarthria, polyneuropathy, and spastic tetraparesis and died at 58?years of age. The patient was born after an uncomplicated pregnancy at the 39th gestational week. His birth measurements were normal. He spent the first weeks of life in hospital because of apnea and slight muscular hypotonia. During the first years of life, he underwent surgery for bilateral clubfoot and retentive testicles. He learnt to walk at 19?months and said his first words at three years of age. Mild ID was diagnosed before school age with associated dysarthria and tremor mainly on the left side in arms and hands both in action and at rest. Etiological studies, including prometaphase chromosomes and fragile X-DNA revealed no cause of disability. Electroneuromyography (ENMG) showed diffuse polyneuropathy. At the age of 10, he had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, and between the ages of 14 to 21 single atonic seizures. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed generalized slowing and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) an unspecific white matter abnormality near the left ventricle. Sodium valproate-lamotrigine combination therapy had a good response. Since the age of 27?years, the condition of the patient has shown progression. The first author met him for the first time when the patient was 28?years old. He had temper attacks with nausea, collapse, and redness of the face lasting for a couple of minutes as well as constant resting and action tremors. He wore sunglasses because of tonic mydriatic pupils. Other ophthalmological findings included nystagmus, strabismus, and meibominitis. His gait was clumsy and slow, and he wore orthopedic shoes. As a skin manifestation, there was purpura pigmentosa around both ankles and several fibromas near the toenails. Array-CGH was normal. Brain MRI revealed no signs of white matter progression. Between the ages of 30 to 34?years, the patient slept only a few hours daily. The motor symptoms in his hands were now dystonic, with massive clonic jerks when reaching for some objects (limb kinetic apraxia). The patient also suffered from dystonic cramps in his toes and feet, resulting in wounds on the soles. Other dystonic symptoms were head nodding, subcutaneous myokymias in the throat, which were easily observed by outsiders, and facial dystonic movements provoked by shaving. Propranolol and gabapentin gave no response. After the initiation of haloperidol, the dystonic symptoms worsened. At this point, sodium valproate was withdrawn but the dystonic symptoms continued to increase. Escitalopram gave some relief to myokymias and nausea redness attacks. Mirtazapine gave no aid to poor sleep. After the withdrawal of lamotrigine, the patient slept better. A new brain MRI showed no changes. At present, the 38-year-old patient manifests Partington syndrome with bradykinesia: a slow and clumsy gait and mild contractures in joints, especially in his ankles. It is difficult for him to initiate movements. Facial dysmorphic features include baldness, hypertelorism, strabismus, and a triangular face. He uses dark glasses.

At birth, the weight was 3,056 g (-0.2 standard deviation [SD]); the length was 49 cm (-0.5 SD); and the occipitofrontal circumference was 39.0 cm (+?4.3 SD). She showed truncal muscular hypotonia and dysmorphic facial features of ocular hypertelorism, strabismus, and anteverted nostrils. Her gross motor development was delayed, and she could run and jump on both feet at the age of 3.5 years. The Tanaka-Binet Intelligence Scale administered at 9 years of age showed a full-scale intelligence quotient of 21. Although the patient demonstrated severe expressive language disorder and communication impairments, she showed no restricted interests or repetitive behaviors, and had never been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Although she had experienced a single afebrile seizure, she had no feeding difficulty. At admission, she had a height of 149.9 cm (-1.1 SD), body weight of 65.4 kg (+?1.8 SD), and body mass index of 29.0. She developed ocular hypertelorism, strabismus, anteverted nostrils, and odontoparallaxis. In the social maturity test, which is a translated version of the Vineland Social Maturity Scale and widely used in Japan, the decline was particularly noticeable in movement, operation, participation, and self-control. Blood tests showed no abnormality, including endocrine dysfunction. We suspected the onset of limbic encephalitis, and the cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed no inflammatory changes or elevation in autoimmune antibody levels. Brain magnetic resonance imaging also showed no abnormalities. A 3-day course of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1,000 mg/day) for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes was ineffective. After discharge, the patient��s emotional instability persisted. Aripiprazole was initiated, and her emotional lability improved reasonably. However, she gradually showed a lack of interest in eating, with decreased diet volume. She presented with significant weight loss. Her swallowing function was normal, and she did not show hypersensitivity to the sensory properties of food (e.g., taste, texture, appearance, and smell). No symptoms of food allergy and family dynamic issues or conflicts were reported. Therefore, ARFID was clinically suspected. We conducted blood tests to assess endocrine function, electrocardiogram, and abdominal ultrasound to rule out organic disorders, and subsequently provided nutritional guidance to restore the child��s interest in food. Additionally, as the parents were concerned about her weight loss, we reassured them by explaining the absence of any organic disorders.

She continued to have macrocephaly with frontal bossing even after her fontanelles closed. At 2 years old, it was noted she had poor dexterity in her fingers, could run but tripped a lot, and continued to turn her foot in and drag it while walking. At this time, she began to have staring spells 1?2 times a week. At 3 years old, she began stuttering while speaking and experiencing unresponsiveness in the middle of conversations. While talking, she would stop and stare, then go back to what she was saying as if nothing had happened. These events occurred about two times a day, lasting 5?10?seconds each time. The patient wore orthotics and a hip brace; her right leg was bigger than her left, and her physical therapist reported a missing gluteal crease.

Clinical examination disclosed left plagiocephaly, axial hypotonia combined to axial dystonic postures with no head control, limited spontaneous and voluntary movements, distal rigidity, increased osteotendinous reflexes in the lower limbs without other pyramidal tract signs. Close assessment of movement disorders identified bradykinesia during most of the day interrupted by several episodes of involuntary, erratic, writhing movements of his face, arms, and legs. These dyskinetic paroxysms lasted between a few minutes to several hours, no evident trigger was identified. Most of the time these movements were fluid, but rapid jerking or slow and extended dystonic postures could occasionally appear. Reduced facial expression was abruptly interrupted by mouth opening dystonia. Involuntary movements disappeared during sleep. Between episodes the patient did not show another kind of movement disorder.

VideoEEG monitoring confirmed previous findings, in addition to epileptiform discharges and spike?wave complexes over both fronto?centro?temporal regions and left fronto?temporal area; seizures were classified as focal motor with undetermined awareness. The epileptiform activity was more prominent over the left hemisphere, broadly corresponding to the area with maximum structural abnormalities, including PMG. Repeated brain MRI detected progression of hydrocephalus, and consequently, the patient received a ventriculo?peritoneal shunt at the age of 4?months. Her seizures persisted and increased in frequency; therefore, the patient was transferred to the department of pediatric neurology for intravenous treatment with phenobarbital and midazolam. At the same time, her brain MRI underwent an expert re?evaluation by a pediatric neuroradiologist who described, in addition to previous findings, PMG, most prominent in the left ventral sylvian area and frontal?parietal regions, and thinning of the optic nerve and optic chiasma. The initial suspicion of holoprosencephaly and septo?optic dysplasia was not confirmed. The patient was discharged on the combination of three antiseizure medications (ASM) (phenobarbital, vigabatrin, and topiramate), experiencing brief focal motor seizures and delayed developmental milestones. At the age of one year, the patient's mother did not report any seizures; however, her EEG remained severely abnormal with epileptiform activity and diminished background activity; the patient is severely developmentally delayed with a visual impairment (does not follow objects, little spontaneous activity, lying on her back, does not turn to belly, muscle hypotonia).

However, the patient presented with 40 pack years of cigarette smoking. The patient did not show any further risk factors for lung cancer such as exposition to asbestos, radiation or other potential hazards. Initial workup included a bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound and transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). However, two consecutive bronchoscopies failed to deliverer a malignant cytology sample of the tumor for further workup. A subsequent fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (FDG-PET-CT) revealed a hypermetabolic tumor of the left lung, various bone metastases of the spine and a singular metastasis of the left adrenal gland. Finally, the histology of the tumor was obtained through drainage of a pleural effusion of the left lung. The initial regimen was Cisplatin (75 mg/m��) and Pemetrexed (500 mg/m��) administered every three weeks, starting mid October 2021. The patient received two cycles of therapy in total without any major side effects. The bone metastases were additionally treated with intravenous infusions of zolendronic acid every other month, commencing in October 2021. The decision to waive radiation therapy in this patient was based on the absence of significant symptom burden associated with bone metastases such as pain or hypercalcemia. Furthermore, there were no osteolytic lesions at risk of fracturing detectable. The patient exhibited good tolerance to zolendronic acid, which was utilized as an adjunctive therapy alongside all systemic treatments thereafter. To monitor therapeutic success, we conducted a computed tomography (CT) scan in December 2021.

During the neonatal period, an episode of transient hypoglycaemia (31 mg/dL and 40 mg/dL) occurred and, therefore, intravenous intake of 10% glucose was required for three days. His hearing assessment was normal. In general, respiratory infections occurred repeatedly throughout childhood. Otitis media occurred at 18 months of age. His development appeared delayed. The boy underwent rehabilitation. He was able to sit since he was 24 months old, and able to walk since he was 4 years old. Tooth eruption was slightly delayed. At the age of 6 months, due to delayed psychomotor development, the boy was hospitalised in the department of paediatric neurology. It was noted that hypotonia occurred since 2 months of life. From the third month of age, an episode of absent staring was noted. An EEG examination showed no deviations. In the 14th month of age, this patient was hospitalised due to fever and an episode of seizures. When in hospital, he was diagnosed with meningitis and encephalitis during the course of a Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, which was treated with vancomycin, cefotaxime, dexamethasone, furosemide and mannitol. Levetiracetam and sodium valproate were recommended to treat seizures. He was treated with sodium valproate for only 3 months. Levetiracetam was discontinued when he was 4 years old. He had no seizures while taking levetiracetam, but a history of anxiety attacks with awakenings at night was noted. Until the age of 5, he had severe sleep problems and woke up restless. The patient stayed under ophthalmological care due to strabismus and nystagmus. he brain MRI examination performed at the age of 6 months revealed a significantly enlarged cisterna magna and moderate dilatation of sulci in the frontal lobes, as well as moderate dilatation of the lateral and third ventricles as a feature of cortico-subcortical atrophy with an adjacent enlargement of the subarachnoid space in the fronto-temporal areas. There was also delayed myelination of the white matter, indicating a typical pattern for the age of 4 months (a high signal intensity of the splenium of the corpus callosum on the T1-weighted image). A follow-up MRI examination was performed at the age of 14 months and showed progression of the myelination process.  However, there were still features of cortico-subcortical atrophy. Moreover, the cortex/white matter differentiation was blurred, especially on the T2-weighted image, instead of being clearly visible at this age, which could indicate a demyelination disorder. From the moment of delivery, sucking and swallowing disorders, regurgitation and anxiety attacks were observed. Up to 4 months of age, the patient was breastfed. During the infancy period, based on the clinical picture (abdominal pain, bloating, regurgitation, anxiety and constipation), allergy to cow proteins was diagnosed and an amino acid-based hypoallergenic formula was applied. Due to constipation, he was treated with macrogol. Since the age of 2, he has remained on a low fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (including being gluten-free). At the age of 5 years and a half, a physical examination performed by a clinical geneticist revealed facial/cranial dysmorphic features, including an asymmetry of the skull with bitemporal narrowing and prominent frontal tubercles, long and thick eyebrows, deep-set eyes, strabismus, low-set ears with prominent auricles, and a consistently open mouth. Other features included a short nose, a low hairline, hyperelastic skin, a short neck, a prominent pectus carinatum, raised shoulder blades and kyphosis.

Her main clinical features include severe global developmental delay, feeding problems, dysmorphic features and hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia. She was born at the 38th week of gestation by spontaneous vaginal delivery, with a birth weight of 4200 g (SDS 1.94), a length of 58 cm (SDS 4.77), a head circumference of 34 cm (SDS 0) and a score of 6/7 points on the Apgar scale. An umbilical cord gas analysis showed a pH of 7.4 and a BE of 0.6. In the physical examination of the newborn, numerous petechiae on the head and trunk were observed. During the neonatal period, there were pneumonia, respiratory failure and thrombocytopenia. An episode of transient hypoglycaemia (12 mg/dL [normal range: 60?99 mg/dL]) occurred 16 h after delivery. On the third day of life, a CT scan of the abdomen and head was performed, and it led to the suspicion of a spleen injury and hypoxic and post-traumatic lesions of the brain (blood/haematoma on the surface of the cerebellar tentorium on the right side, and suspicion of indentation injuries to the skull bones). Moreover, a transfontanellar ultrasound showed calcifications along the course of the lenticulostriatal vessels. . At 8 months of age, a hearing test based on wave V yielded a bilateral threshold of 30 dBnHL at 2?4 kHz (mild hearing loss). Recurrent lower respiratory tract infections occurred throughout the first year of life, often presenting with shortness of breath and respiratory failure. A noticeable gross motor and fine motor delay was observed (she was able to roll over, but not yet able to achieve the ability to sit). Speech was absent. There was a significant delay in tooth eruption (first teeth at 12 months of age). From the age of 2 months onwards, seizure incidents of various morphologies without fever and episodes of unconsciousness were observed. A sleep EEG performed at the age of 2.5 months showed bifocal seizure activity, which led to the application of a phenobarbital treatment. No epileptic seizures were observed from the commencing of the medication administration up till the 13th month of life. Afterwards, several incidents of immobility with eye rotation and increased muscle tone were noted, and an epileptic episode with the morphology of limb tremor with eye rotation to the right and mouth open occurred. A sleep EEG performed at the age of 14 months showed background disorganization and epileptiform discharges. Seizures remained intractable despite treatment with antiepileptic drugs, such as lamotrigine and phenobarbital. A brain MRI examination performed at the age of 14 months revealed an absence of normal myelination according to the age of the child. The T1- and T2-weighted images suggested delayed myelination of the cerebral white matter. The MRI appearance indicated a stage of myelination that was typical for the age of 8 months as there was a pronounced difference between the ��anterior�� and ��posterior�� parts of the brain, which was visible on the T1-weighted image with a lower signal within the former one. However, cortex/white matter differentiation could be detected instead of being blurred, which is a typical finding of a normal myelination process, meaning that a dysmyelination disorder should be suspected in this child. There was also dilatation of the lateral ventricles, the third ventricle and the cerebral sulci as a sign of cerebral cortico-subcortical atrophy. The MRI also showed a cavum septum pellucidum, which is a normal variant of the CSF space, between the leaflets of the septum pellucidum. The patient was initially fed by a nasogastric tube with breast milk, then with a first infant formula. Abdominal pain and constipation suggested food allergy. After modifying the diet (hydrolysed whey protein) and pharmacological treatment (macrogol, trimebutine and omeprazole), a partial improvement was observed. At the age of 11 months, the patient was admitted to the gastroenterological ward due to feeding problems, such as food retraction, spitting up and gag reflex. The patient��s weight was 10.26 kg, with a length of 74 cm (weight-to-length ratio at 90?97th percentile). At 12 months of age, due to a gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as well as recurrent aspiration pneumonia, a Nissen fundoplication was performed and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was placed. Until now, the patient is under the care of the nutrition ward. Currently, she is fed through a gastrostomy with a liquid, high-calorie diet (hydrolysed whey protein). Due to orofacial disorders, neurologopedic rehabilitation was recommended. In the second year of life, a reduction in the incidence of lower respiratory tract infections was observed (pneumonia and bronchitis), although she suffered from purulent otitis three times during this period. A physical examination at the age of 22 months performed by a clinical geneticist revealed facial/skull dysmorphic features resembling Cornelia de Lange syndrome, such as small teeth, a consistently open mouth, a low hairline, prominent eyebrows, and increased hairiness on the lower legs, thighs and forearms. Excessive skin between the fingers of the hands, proximal displacement of the thumb, strabismus, nystagmus, hypotonia and increased excitability were also observed.

At the age of 30 months, her current weight is 11.9 kg, her height is 90 cm (25?50th percentile, HSDS-0.53), and her BMI is 14.69 kg/m2. ",ZMYND11,1
PMID38134071,"a 26-year-old man presented with frequent ecchymosis (bruising) and was found to have thrombocytopenia (platelet count?=?22?��?109/L). Further laboratory investigations confirmed macrothrombocytopenia (presence of abnormally large platelets) and D?hle body-like inclusions in the blood smear. The patient��s clinic1al history reveals a long-standing history of frequent nasal bleeding and bruising since childhood. Previous visits to multiple hospitals failed to identify the exact cause of the thrombocytopenia. Additionally, the patient has been experiencing hematuria (blood in urine) since the age of 20 years. Laboratory tests revealed unremarkable results for coagulation function, clotting factors, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase levels.",MYH9,0
PMID38827217,"The patient, born at term following an uncomplicated pregnancy, is the only daughter of healthy, non-consanguineous Japanese parents. There is no family history of hearing loss, renal insufficiency, presenile cataracts, or hematological disorders. Although she has had petechiae since infancy, she has not undergone any examinations. At the age of three years, thrombocytopenia was incidentally noted during a review for a generalized erythematous maculopapular rash. She was diagnosed with ITP and was subsequently followed up without treatment at a local hospital. At the request of the patient's family for an assessment of thrombocytopenia by pediatric hematologists, the patient was referred to our hospital. Physical examination revealed no purpura on the legs, petechiae in the oral cavity, or hearing loss. Peripheral blood analysis revealed thrombocytopenia, with a platelet count of 53?��?109/L (normal range 150?400?��?109/L). White blood cell and erythrocyte counts were 9.8?��?109/L (normal range 4.0?15.0?��?109/L) and 4.85?��?1012/L (normal range 4.00?5.30?��?1012/L), respectively. Other laboratory data, including creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, liver profiles, prothrombin time, and partial thromboplastin time, were all within normal limits, with a creatinine level of 0.23?mg/dl (normal range 0.20?0.39?mg/dl), an alanine aminotransferase level of 9?U/L (normal range 9?30?U/L), and an aspartate aminotransferase level of 62?U/L (normal range 24?44?U/L). Urinalysis results were normal, with no evidence of hematuria or proteinuria. Audiometric and ophthalmological findings were normal. Examination of peripheral blood films (May-Gr?nwald-Giemsa stain) by light microscopy showed giant platelets and D?hle-like inclusions in neutrophils. ",MYH9,0
PMID38558752,"A lady in her 20s with no known medical illness was found to have incidental thrombocytopenia (Platelet: 75 x 103/?L) during her first pregnancy. Her pregnancy progressed well, and it culminated with an emergency C-section for fetal distress. No postpartum hemorrhage or any bleeding diasthesis was reported. She was presumed to have gestational thrombocytopenia with no record of a repeated platelet count during the postpartum period. Two years later, she was referred to our center during her second pregnancy in the second trimester due to similar findings of thrombocytopenia (Platelet: 78 x 103/?L). She had no bleeding, fever, symptoms suggestive of SLE, or constitutional symptoms suggestive of malignancy. She had no history of any medications, over-the-counter or prescribed. Her height and weight were 165cm and 65kg, respectively, with a BMI of 23.9 kg/m2. No joint tenderness, palpable purpura, ecchymoses, or hemoarthrosis were found on examination and there was also no hepatosplenomegaly, or lymphadenopathy appreciated. we diagnosed her as Gestational Thrombocytopenia with Immune thrombocytopenic purpura as differential. As she was pregnant, we did not perform any bone marrow biopsy. ",MYH9,0
PMID38550428,"A 27-year-old male patient was consulted postoperatively because of chronic ITP after splenectomy for further follow-up. As far as it was learned from his history, he had been followed up in another center with a diagnosis of ITP since the age of three, and he received steroids, intravenous immune globulin several times, and platelet suspension when needed. While investigating because of proteinuria, he was diagnosed with chronic kidney failure four years ago and he has been prepared for renal replacement therapy. Although he did not have any complaints about hearing, mild hearing loss in one ear was also detected. His eye examination was normal. It was learned that there were individuals with thrombocytopenia in his family, but they were never examined in this respect. In our initial hematologic examination one month after splenectomy, he had thrombocytopenia (4,000/mm3) and mild anemia (hemoglobin 9.52 g/dL). Giant platelets almost as big as an erythrocyte observed in peripheral blood smear (PBS) were very remarkable and the platelet count in PBS was calculated as 40,000/mm3. The D?hle body could not be observed in the granulocytes.",MYH9,0
PMID37201161,"The patient was born from the first physiological pregnancy. He has been in medical follow-up by the hematologist for thrombocytopenia from birth. Platelet values were 46?81 �� 109/L (reference range 140?400 �� 109/L). Peripheral blood smear was not typical for thrombocytopenia with giant platelet. Mean platelet volume was 10.5 fL (reference range 7.5?12.0 fL). Platelet aggregation test was physiological. Bone marrow examination (11 years old) was normal. Patient��s mother and younger sister were also in medical follow-up for thrombocytopenia (platelets of physiological size and normal mean platelet volume). Systolic hypertension with maximum systolic blood pressure of 155 mm Hg and nephrotic proteinuria (proteinuria 4.2 g/24 h, reference range 0.000?0.150 g/24 h and macroalbuminuria 4,295 mg/L, reference range 0.0?30.0 mg/L) were detected at preventive health check (14 years old). Creatinine level was 140 ��mol/L (reference range 45?104 ��mol/L) and urea 7 mmol/L (reference range 1.8?6.4 mmol/L). In the blood count, hemoglobin was 136 g/L (reference range 140?179 g/L), thrombocytes 36 �� 109/L without leukocytosis and leukocyte inclusions (D?hle's bodies). Renal ultrasound showed both kidneys of normal size (12.3 �� 5 cm) with increased parenchymal echogenicity. 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring confirmed hypertension. A renal biopsy revealed sing of segmental glomerulosclerosis (biopsy sample of 8 glomeruli of which 6 are completely sclerotic). In the preserved glomeruli, there was a picture of thickening, splitting, and reduplication of the basement membrane of glomeruli, signs of glomerulosclerosis, mesangiolysis, concentrically thickened wall of the arterioles and signs of tubular atrophy with necrotic casts. Since no glomeruli were present in the sample for immunofluorescence examination, it was not possible to reliably determine whether it was unclassified group of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. A hearing examination did not confirm conductive or perceptual hearing impairment. Examination of eye background and anterior segment was physiological. The renal function gradually deteriorated and dialysis treatment (peritoneal dialysis) was initiated 2 years after the onset of the disease. ",MYH9,0
PMID37000325,"A 15-year-old girl was referred to our institution for the initiation of PD. She exhibited normal physical and mental development. Proteinuria was first detected during a routine school urinalysis when she was 6 years old, and further evaluation showed macrothrombocytopenia. The patient��s kidney function gradually declined, and she progressed to end-stage kidney disease at the age of 15 years. No inclusion bodies were present in the patient��s leukocytes, hearing was normal in both ears, and no cataract was observed in either eye. Although the patient had no family history of kidney disease or hematological disease, her father had died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 43 years. ",MYH9,0
PMID38406554,"The proband was a 2.5-year-old girl with normal birth and neonatal history. She was the second child of nonconsanguineous healthy parents. At 5?months of age, she experienced her first afebrile seizure following a bout of diarrhea. The seizure was characterized by staring, eye deviation to the left, cyanosis, dribbling foam-like saliva, and bilateral jerks. This episode lasted about one minute and was followed by post-ictal sleep. Subsequently, she experienced another afebrile seizure 3-4?hours after awakening. The initial seizure episode recurred 3-4 times per day over a period of 3-4?days. Following this, she continued to have recurrent afebrile seizures, often in association with colds or diarrhea, with a similar frequency and duration as the initial seizure. At 9.7?months of age, the patient underwent a comprehensive examination at the hospital. Laboratory tests and cranial MRI showed no abnormalities. An EEG scan conducted during sleep demonstrated sharp waves in the frontal central area and small spike waves in bilateral central and central midline areas. The child demonstrated normal cognitive and social development up to 15?months of age, achieving milestones such as sitting unaided at 7?months, crawling at 9?months, and uttering four meaningful words (��dad,�� ��mom,�� ��grandma,�� and ��brother��) at 12?months. By 14?months, she was walking independently. However, at 15?months of age, her language and communication skills regressed, and stereotyped and repetitive behaviors emerged, such as pressing buttons and arranging toys, along with difficulties in coping with minor changes. She displayed a poor response to her name, withdrawal, and deteriorating social gaze, with a gradual disappearance of communicative gestures and language.",PRRT2,0
PMID37371788,"The patient is a 6-year-old girl. She is the fourth child in a large family. Her parents are unrelated and come from the same region. The pregnancy was unremarkable. The birth weight was 3000 g and the body length was 43 cm. Triple X syndrome, ICP, and hip dysplasia were diagnosed in the first year of life. The generalized seizures began at the age of 1.5 months and the patient had been treated with anticonvulsants for five years. There were no seizure relapses during anticonvulsant therapy and after its withdrawal. A low-grade fever of unknown origin was observed during the first year when seizures began. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the first year of life showed ventricular dilatation. The girl has psychomotor development delay and spastic tetraparesis with the 5th level of Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). She neither talks nor communicates with the outside world and only uses vocalizations and social smiles. The erythematous rash appeared on the neck, chest, nape, and face at the age of 5.5 years. Then, periorbital erythema developed. Wrist edema, periorbital edema, weakness, and low-grade fever were observed during 1 month. Sleep disorder occurred. Infections and allergic conditions were excluded. Juvenile dermatomyositis was suspected. Widespread erythematous rash with cyanotic discoloration on the upper extremities, on the chest and the neck, periorbital edema and erythema, and alopecia on the back of the head. The girl had spastic tetraparesis. She also had swelling of her hand joints, as well as swelling and local hyperthermia of the left knee. Laboratory tests revealed mild inflammation with normal creatine kinase, hypergammaglobulinemia and negative immunological markers. Whole-body MRI was performed to assess muscle inflammation. Diffuse MR-signal increase on T2 and STIR was determined in the upper and lower muscle extremities and the pelvic and back muscles.  There were signs of bilateral hip joint dislocations. Electroneuromyography revealed signs of an active stage of primary muscular lesion of the pectoralis major and supraspinatus muscles, as well as indirect signs of inactive lesions of the anterior tibial muscle.",SAMHD1,0
