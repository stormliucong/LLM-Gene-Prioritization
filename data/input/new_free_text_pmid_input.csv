PMID36878902,"The proband was a male born at term with respiratory failure. Soon thereafter, he developed bilateral pneumothoraces and was noted to have suprasystemic pulmonary hypertension with right-to-left flow across a large patent ductus arteriosus. He was initially treated with inhaled nitric oxide and later transitioned to oral sildenafil. By age 3?months, he was weaned off mechanical ventilation when an echocardiogram showed right ventricular pressure less than half of systemic pressure. He was discharged home, self-ventilating on room air with no requirement for pulmonary hypertension medications. At age 15?months the proband returned for follow-up and was noted to be intermittently tachypneic. Echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization showed pulmonary hypertension, and sildenafil was reinitiated. A chest CT showed a paucity of lung markings and perihilar peribronchial wall thickening. Over the subsequent 2?years, his lung disease progressed, with a 4?L oxygen requirement and moderate pulmonary hypertension treated with tadalafil and bosentan.

The family history revealed a father, aunt, and grandfather in the paternal lineage with multiple head and neck paragangliomas. At the age of 19, both CBTs were surgically removed. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of bilateral paraganglioma. Three years after surgery, the patient noticed recurrence of the swelling in the neck on the right, and at the age of 27, recurrence of the right CBT was diagnosed with MR imaging (Figure 1). In addition, the MRI showed bilateral vagal paragangliomas with the left-sided tumor slowly progressive over time. In the following years, paresis of the right vocal cord developed, accompanied by hoarseness that was acceptable for the patient. At the age of 34, the patient was diagnosed with an additional jugulotympanic paraganglioma on the left side, which was partly surgically removed 16?years later because of troublesome pulsatile tinnitus.

PMID37396576,"The proband was a 14-year-old female who presented with a two-year history of reduced tolerance to physical exertion and subsequently experienced severe dyspnea, respiratory distress, and fatigue following exertion. The patient suffered a sudden cardiac arrest 2?h before arrival at the hospital, during which carotid pulsation and respiratory movement were absent. CPR and defibrillation were promptly administered by first-aid personnel, resulting in the return of heartbeats after 15?min and restoration of sinus rhythm. Nevertheless, the patient remained unconscious and exhibited no spontaneous breathing. The patient was transferred to the emergency department while receiving laryngeal mask ventilation and subsequently underwent tracheal intubation, positive pressure ventilation, fluid infusion, sedation, and analgesia. The patient was later transferred to the cardiac intensive care unit one hour after the cardiac arrest. The patient's parents denied any history of illness, especially cardiovascular disorders, and any family history of cardiac arrest or cardiovascular disease. Notably, no family member had a history of hypertension or coronary artery disease. Upon arrival at the cardiac intensive care unit, the patient's blood pressure was approximately 92/63?mmHg, and arterial oxygen saturation was maintained at 97% through mechanical ventilation. Physical examination revealed the patient to be comatose with significant cardiac enlargement, thoracolumbar scoliosis, and muscle weakness. The electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed right axis deviation, biventricular hypertrophy, and ventricular escape beats. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed significant hypertrophy of the left ventricular wall, particularly the interventricular septum (IVS) and left posterior ventricular wall (LVPW). In addition, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) demonstrated diffuse hypertrophy of the ventricular myocardium. Furthermore, the T2-weighted image revealed an abnormal signal intensity of the left ventricular subendocardial myocardium indicating myocardial ischemia. ",ALPK3,0
PMID38317675,"A full-term male infant was referred at 4 months of age for ��jittery�� movements of limbs and poor feeding. Antenatal, perinatal and neonatal course prior to presentation were unremarkable and developmental milestones were appropriate. Neurological and systems examination, apart from mild intermittent peripheral increased tone, were otherwise normal. Head circumference was 41 cm (25th centile). Initial baseline biochemistry and metabolic screen, and cranial ultrasound were normal. At age 5 months he developed episodes of extensor posturing. A CT and MRI brain showed benign increased extra-axial CSF spaces, but no other abnormality. The jittery movements persisted, and by nine months he had experienced developmental regression across all domains; no longer able to sit, move on all fours or pull to stand, nor reaching for objects. He stopped smiling socially, could only fix on objects briefly and exhibited nonspecific babbles. He was also noted to have jittery head and hand movements, and paroxysms of trunk stiffening as well as staring. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed an active epileptic encephalopathy characterised by generalised (bi-synchronous) high amplitude sharp waves, almost continuous at times, with periods of marked background attenuation and electro-decrement during sleep. He had short generalised tonic seizures, as well as generalised epileptic spasms. By the age of 2 years, seizure activity was largely characterised by generalised tonic seizures, atonic seizures and epileptic spasms, refractory to multiple therapies (including corticosteroids, sodium valproate, clobazam, ACTH, vigabatrin, levetiracetam, lamotrigine, topiramate, rufinamide, phenobarbitone, and the ketogenic diet). The early-onset involuntary jittery movements of head and arms progressed to a mixed hyperkinetic movement disorder. During wakefulness he became restless (with leg kicking, arms waving about), developed stereotypies (headbanging, rocking, teeth grinding, tongue protrusion), gratification, and choreoathetosis involving head, arms, and legs (sometimes ballistic), unrelated to seizure activity, and dissipating in sleep. A vagal nerve stimulator (VNS) was inserted at 5 years of age, which reduced motor seizures and frequency of status epilepticus. Currently, at age 15 years he is treated with multiple ASMs (sodium valproate, phenobarbitone, nitrazepam), with ongoing daily seizures (tonic, tonic-clonic, atypical absences). At age 15 years, the hyperkinetic movement disorder is prominent and includes choreoathetosis of limbs, head, as well as oro-lingual dyskinesia, with episodes of agitation, and discomfort requiring oral clonidine. He is profoundly neurologically impaired, non-verbal and non-ambulant. Earlier childhood was also complicated by recurrent otitis media, scoliosis, gastrostomy and precocious puberty.",ANKRD1,0
PMID37800809,"The study reported a 1-month-old female proband with Han nationality whose non-consanguineous parents were healthy with no family history of genetic disorders or contagious diseases. She was the first birth from the 23-year-old mother, who was diagnosed as gestational hypertension at 5 months�� gestation. During pregnancy, 2 tests for Down��s syndrome suggested high potential risk, in contrast to the results of noninvasive prenatal testing that indicated no abnormalities in the fetus. At 31?+?2 weeks�� gestation, an emergency cesarean section was performed in People��s Hospital of Yuncheng County due to severe preeclampsia, severe placental abruption with a separation area of 4/5, and slow fetal heart rate. Neonatal physical examination recorded a birth weight of 1.18?kg and a heart rate of 70 bpm, together with birth asphyxia, bluish discoloration on the skin, flaccid limbs, and unresponsiveness. Medical intervention was carried out immediately, including warmth keeping, airway clearing, and 30 seconds of positive pressure ventilation using resuscitation device. The subsequent examination revealed improved muscular tone, with the heart rate recorded as >100 bpm and 1-minute Apgar score rated as 5. But crying was still not observed in this newborn. No abnormalities were detected in amniotic fluid and umbilical cord. Blood tests indicated significantly increased procalcitonin (100?ng/mL) as well as relatively low platelet count (124?��?109/L) accompanied by coagulation dysfunction as demonstrated by difficulty in stopping the bleeding on the puncture sites. The brain sonography on day 4 after birth showed brain injury and intracranial hemorrhage. Therefore, 140?mg of bovine lung surfactant was administered through endotracheal intubation in addition to ventilator-assisted ventilation. Antibiotic treatment was also given till the inflammatory indicators of the infant returned to normal levels. During the hospitalization, recurrent fever was noted 4 times during 1 month, accompanied by elevated levels of white blood cells, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin. Besides, 2 apnea episodes were also observed within 27 days. The immature infant was malnourished with poor response and tachypnea. The inspection revealed less ruddy skin with an uneven texture, and scattered petechiae on the limbs caused by venipuncture. The anterior fontanel, which remained unclosed, measured about 2 cm?��?2?cm. Perioral cyanosis and the congestion in pharyngeal mucosa were also noted in the examination. Retraction sign of 3 fossae was negative. Pulmonary auscultation suggested coarse breathing sounds in bilateral lungs without rhonchi or moist rales. A stable heart rate of 160 bpm along with strong cardiac sounds was registered, with no murmurs heard in any of the auscultatory valve areas. Abdominal palpation indicated abdominal distension and mild muscular hypertonicity. The abdominal circumference was measured as 27?cm. Abdominal compression did not elicit crying or painful expressions. No mass was spotted in abdominal palpation, by which the liver and spleen were also not touched. The bowel sounds were 3 times/min. Examination of the fingers suggested normal capillary filling time and nail-bed pallor but with no cyanosis. No abnormality was found in muscle tone test of the extremities. The clinical diagnosis was eventually confirmed as neonatal sepsis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Repeated blood routine tests all showed increased leukocyte levels beyond the upper limit of normal range, with the highest recorded as 28.67?��?109/L, which was mainly attributed to elevated counts of lymphocytes. The results also revealed lifted C-reactive protein levels as high as 46.50?mg/L and lowered platelet counts down to 45?��?109/L. The infant suffered sustained anemia, as demonstrated by declined erythrocyte counts as low as 2.79?��?1012/L and the decrease in hemoglobin with a minimum value of 75?g/L. Bone marrow smears suggested significantly active bone marrow hyperplasia, with lymphocytes accounting for 48%, juvenile lymphocytes for 2.5%, granulocytes for 30%, and erythrocytes for 21%. In the myelogramme, all stages of granulocytes were coexisted, with a higher ratio of neutrophilic myelocytes observed, while polychromatic and orthochromatic normoblasts were predominant in erythrocytic series. Besides, no anomaly was detected pertaining to the thyroid function, as well as the levels of immunoglobulin, antinuclear antibody, 25-hydroxyvitamin D and urinary calcium/creatinine ratio. The following-up of 1-year-6-month showed that the language, motion and height of development is slight falling behind the children of the same age.",ANKRD1,0

PMID37485122,"A 29-year-old, gravida 4, booked mother delivered a female baby vaginally at 40 weeks and one day of gestation at our institute. The mother��s first pregnancy was medically terminated at 20 weeks of gestation in view of a large para-midline anechoic supratentorial cyst in the fetus. Her second pregnancy resulted in a live healthy male baby, while the third pregnancy resulted in a blighted ovum followed by an abortion at one and a half months of amenorrhea. The current pregnancy was booked, and on a level 2 scan, the fetus was found to have an anechoic lesion in the brain which was investigated further with a fetal MRI. MRI revealed isolated ACC. She did not have a history suggestive of an intrauterine infection, and her TORCH screening was negative. The mother��s blood group was O Rh-negative, not iso-immunized, and she received anti-D immunoglobulin. The rest of the antenatal period was uneventful, and all antenatal visits were completed. The mother had partial ACC, with a history of seizure disorder controlled on a single antiepileptic between 1996 and 2008 with no requirement of any antiepileptic for the last 13 years. The neonate cried immediately after birth. The APGAR score was 8 and 9 at one and five minutes, respectively. The neonate received routine care at birth. The birth weight was 2,940 g which was appropriate for gestational age per the Intergrowth-21 newborn size at birth charts. Length and head circumference was 48 cm and 33.5 cm, respectively, both between the 10th and 50th centile per the Intergrowth-21 size at birth charts. General physical and neurological examinations at birth were normal, and the neonate was initiated on breastfeeding. A detailed workup for antenatally diagnosed ACC was done. An ophthalmological examination was done to rule out chorioretinal lacunae without any significant findings. Her TORCH screening was negative. Ultrasound of the cranium revealed an absence of the corpus callosum, colpocephaly, and a subependymal cyst in the left caudothalamic groove without any features of hydrocephalus. Ultrasound of the abdomen, kidney, and urinary bladder was normal. Echocardiography revealed a 5 mm atrial septal defect. Automated brainstem evoked response audiometry was normal bilaterally and so was the infantogram. MRI revealed an absence of the corpus callosum with colpocephaly and a characteristic Viking helmet appearance. ",ARX,0
PMID36816814,"The patient is the second of three children of a nonconsanguineous couple. The 70-year-old mother and two brothers are healthy. From the age of 50, the father suffered from a progressive neurological condition of unknown cause characterized by ataxia, dysarthria, polyneuropathy, and spastic tetraparesis and died at 58?years of age. The patient was born after an uncomplicated pregnancy at the 39th gestational week. His birth measurements were normal. He spent the first weeks of life in hospital because of apnea and slight muscular hypotonia. During the first years of life, he underwent surgery for bilateral clubfoot and retentive testicles. He learnt to walk at 19?months and said his first words at three years of age. Mild ID was diagnosed before school age with associated dysarthria and tremor mainly on the left side in arms and hands both in action and at rest. Etiological studies, including prometaphase chromosomes and fragile X-DNA revealed no cause of disability. Electroneuromyography (ENMG) showed diffuse polyneuropathy. At the age of 10, he had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, and between the ages of 14 to 21 single atonic seizures. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed generalized slowing and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) an unspecific white matter abnormality near the left ventricle. Sodium valproate-lamotrigine combination therapy had a good response. Since the age of 27?years, the condition of the patient has shown progression. The first author met him for the first time when the patient was 28?years old. He had temper attacks with nausea, collapse, and redness of the face lasting for a couple of minutes as well as constant resting and action tremors. He wore sunglasses because of tonic mydriatic pupils. Other ophthalmological findings included nystagmus, strabismus, and meibominitis. His gait was clumsy and slow, and he wore orthopedic shoes. As a skin manifestation, there was purpura pigmentosa around both ankles and several fibromas near the toenails. Array-CGH was normal. Brain MRI revealed no signs of white matter progression. Between the ages of 30 to 34?years, the patient slept only a few hours daily. The motor symptoms in his hands were now dystonic, with massive clonic jerks when reaching for some objects (limb kinetic apraxia). The patient also suffered from dystonic cramps in his toes and feet, resulting in wounds on the soles. Other dystonic symptoms were head nodding, subcutaneous myokymias in the throat, which were easily observed by outsiders, and facial dystonic movements provoked by shaving. Propranolol and gabapentin gave no response. After the initiation of haloperidol, the dystonic symptoms worsened. At this point, sodium valproate was withdrawn but the dystonic symptoms continued to increase. Escitalopram gave some relief to myokymias and nausea redness attacks. Mirtazapine gave no aid to poor sleep. After the withdrawal of lamotrigine, the patient slept better. A new brain MRI showed no changes. At present, the 38-year-old patient manifests Partington syndrome with bradykinesia: a slow and clumsy gait and mild contractures in joints, especially in his ankles. It is difficult for him to initiate movements. Facial dysmorphic features include baldness, hypertelorism, strabismus, and a triangular face. He uses dark glasses.

At birth, the weight was 3,056 g (-0.2 standard deviation [SD]); the length was 49 cm (-0.5 SD); and the occipitofrontal circumference was 39.0 cm (+?4.3 SD). She showed truncal muscular hypotonia and dysmorphic facial features of ocular hypertelorism, strabismus, and anteverted nostrils. Her gross motor development was delayed, and she could run and jump on both feet at the age of 3.5 years. The Tanaka-Binet Intelligence Scale administered at 9 years of age showed a full-scale intelligence quotient of 21. Although the patient demonstrated severe expressive language disorder and communication impairments, she showed no restricted interests or repetitive behaviors, and had never been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. Although she had experienced a single afebrile seizure, she had no feeding difficulty. At admission, she had a height of 149.9 cm (-1.1 SD), body weight of 65.4 kg (+?1.8 SD), and body mass index of 29.0. She developed ocular hypertelorism, strabismus, anteverted nostrils, and odontoparallaxis. In the social maturity test, which is a translated version of the Vineland Social Maturity Scale and widely used in Japan, the decline was particularly noticeable in movement, operation, participation, and self-control. Blood tests showed no abnormality, including endocrine dysfunction. We suspected the onset of limbic encephalitis, and the cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed no inflammatory changes or elevation in autoimmune antibody levels. Brain magnetic resonance imaging also showed no abnormalities. A 3-day course of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1,000 mg/day) for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes was ineffective. After discharge, the patient��s emotional instability persisted. Aripiprazole was initiated, and her emotional lability improved reasonably. However, she gradually showed a lack of interest in eating, with decreased diet volume. She presented with significant weight loss. Her swallowing function was normal, and she did not show hypersensitivity to the sensory properties of food (e.g., taste, texture, appearance, and smell). No symptoms of food allergy and family dynamic issues or conflicts were reported. Therefore, ARFID was clinically suspected. We conducted blood tests to assess endocrine function, electrocardiogram, and abdominal ultrasound to rule out organic disorders, and subsequently provided nutritional guidance to restore the child��s interest in food. Additionally, as the parents were concerned about her weight loss, we reassured them by explaining the absence of any organic disorders.

She continued to have macrocephaly with frontal bossing even after her fontanelles closed. At 2 years old, it was noted she had poor dexterity in her fingers, could run but tripped a lot, and continued to turn her foot in and drag it while walking. At this time, she began to have staring spells 1?2 times a week. At 3 years old, she began stuttering while speaking and experiencing unresponsiveness in the middle of conversations. While talking, she would stop and stare, then go back to what she was saying as if nothing had happened. These events occurred about two times a day, lasting 5?10?seconds each time. The patient wore orthotics and a hip brace; her right leg was bigger than her left, and her physical therapist reported a missing gluteal crease.

Clinical examination disclosed left plagiocephaly, axial hypotonia combined to axial dystonic postures with no head control, limited spontaneous and voluntary movements, distal rigidity, increased osteotendinous reflexes in the lower limbs without other pyramidal tract signs. Close assessment of movement disorders identified bradykinesia during most of the day interrupted by several episodes of involuntary, erratic, writhing movements of his face, arms, and legs. These dyskinetic paroxysms lasted between a few minutes to several hours, no evident trigger was identified. Most of the time these movements were fluid, but rapid jerking or slow and extended dystonic postures could occasionally appear. Reduced facial expression was abruptly interrupted by mouth opening dystonia. Involuntary movements disappeared during sleep. Between episodes the patient did not show another kind of movement disorder.

VideoEEG monitoring confirmed previous findings, in addition to epileptiform discharges and spike?wave complexes over both fronto?centro?temporal regions and left fronto?temporal area; seizures were classified as focal motor with undetermined awareness. The epileptiform activity was more prominent over the left hemisphere, broadly corresponding to the area with maximum structural abnormalities, including PMG. Repeated brain MRI detected progression of hydrocephalus, and consequently, the patient received a ventriculo?peritoneal shunt at the age of 4?months. Her seizures persisted and increased in frequency; therefore, the patient was transferred to the department of pediatric neurology for intravenous treatment with phenobarbital and midazolam. At the same time, her brain MRI underwent an expert re?evaluation by a pediatric neuroradiologist who described, in addition to previous findings, PMG, most prominent in the left ventral sylvian area and frontal?parietal regions, and thinning of the optic nerve and optic chiasma. The initial suspicion of holoprosencephaly and septo?optic dysplasia was not confirmed. The patient was discharged on the combination of three antiseizure medications (ASM) (phenobarbital, vigabatrin, and topiramate), experiencing brief focal motor seizures and delayed developmental milestones. At the age of one year, the patient's mother did not report any seizures; however, her EEG remained severely abnormal with epileptiform activity and diminished background activity; the patient is severely developmentally delayed with a visual impairment (does not follow objects, little spontaneous activity, lying on her back, does not turn to belly, muscle hypotonia).

However, the patient presented with 40 pack years of cigarette smoking. The patient did not show any further risk factors for lung cancer such as exposition to asbestos, radiation or other potential hazards. Initial workup included a bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound and transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). However, two consecutive bronchoscopies failed to deliverer a malignant cytology sample of the tumor for further workup. A subsequent fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (FDG-PET-CT) revealed a hypermetabolic tumor of the left lung, various bone metastases of the spine and a singular metastasis of the left adrenal gland. Finally, the histology of the tumor was obtained through drainage of a pleural effusion of the left lung. The initial regimen was Cisplatin (75 mg/m��) and Pemetrexed (500 mg/m��) administered every three weeks, starting mid October 2021. The patient received two cycles of therapy in total without any major side effects. The bone metastases were additionally treated with intravenous infusions of zolendronic acid every other month, commencing in October 2021. The decision to waive radiation therapy in this patient was based on the absence of significant symptom burden associated with bone metastases such as pain or hypercalcemia. Furthermore, there were no osteolytic lesions at risk of fracturing detectable. The patient exhibited good tolerance to zolendronic acid, which was utilized as an adjunctive therapy alongside all systemic treatments thereafter. To monitor therapeutic success, we conducted a computed tomography (CT) scan in December 2021.

During the neonatal period, an episode of transient hypoglycaemia (31 mg/dL and 40 mg/dL) occurred and, therefore, intravenous intake of 10% glucose was required for three days. His hearing assessment was normal. In general, respiratory infections occurred repeatedly throughout childhood. Otitis media occurred at 18 months of age. His development appeared delayed. The boy underwent rehabilitation. He was able to sit since he was 24 months old, and able to walk since he was 4 years old. Tooth eruption was slightly delayed. At the age of 6 months, due to delayed psychomotor development, the boy was hospitalised in the department of paediatric neurology. It was noted that hypotonia occurred since 2 months of life. From the third month of age, an episode of absent staring was noted. An EEG examination showed no deviations. In the 14th month of age, this patient was hospitalised due to fever and an episode of seizures. When in hospital, he was diagnosed with meningitis and encephalitis during the course of a Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, which was treated with vancomycin, cefotaxime, dexamethasone, furosemide and mannitol. Levetiracetam and sodium valproate were recommended to treat seizures. He was treated with sodium valproate for only 3 months. Levetiracetam was discontinued when he was 4 years old. He had no seizures while taking levetiracetam, but a history of anxiety attacks with awakenings at night was noted. Until the age of 5, he had severe sleep problems and woke up restless. The patient stayed under ophthalmological care due to strabismus and nystagmus. he brain MRI examination performed at the age of 6 months revealed a significantly enlarged cisterna magna and moderate dilatation of sulci in the frontal lobes, as well as moderate dilatation of the lateral and third ventricles as a feature of cortico-subcortical atrophy with an adjacent enlargement of the subarachnoid space in the fronto-temporal areas. There was also delayed myelination of the white matter, indicating a typical pattern for the age of 4 months (a high signal intensity of the splenium of the corpus callosum on the T1-weighted image). A follow-up MRI examination was performed at the age of 14 months and showed progression of the myelination process.  However, there were still features of cortico-subcortical atrophy. Moreover, the cortex/white matter differentiation was blurred, especially on the T2-weighted image, instead of being clearly visible at this age, which could indicate a demyelination disorder. From the moment of delivery, sucking and swallowing disorders, regurgitation and anxiety attacks were observed. Up to 4 months of age, the patient was breastfed. During the infancy period, based on the clinical picture (abdominal pain, bloating, regurgitation, anxiety and constipation), allergy to cow proteins was diagnosed and an amino acid-based hypoallergenic formula was applied. Due to constipation, he was treated with macrogol. Since the age of 2, he has remained on a low fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide and polyol (FODMAP) diet (including being gluten-free). At the age of 5 years and a half, a physical examination performed by a clinical geneticist revealed facial/cranial dysmorphic features, including an asymmetry of the skull with bitemporal narrowing and prominent frontal tubercles, long and thick eyebrows, deep-set eyes, strabismus, low-set ears with prominent auricles, and a consistently open mouth. Other features included a short nose, a low hairline, hyperelastic skin, a short neck, a prominent pectus carinatum, raised shoulder blades and kyphosis.

Her main clinical features include severe global developmental delay, feeding problems, dysmorphic features and hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia. She was born at the 38th week of gestation by spontaneous vaginal delivery, with a birth weight of 4200 g (SDS 1.94), a length of 58 cm (SDS 4.77), a head circumference of 34 cm (SDS 0) and a score of 6/7 points on the Apgar scale. An umbilical cord gas analysis showed a pH of 7.4 and a BE of 0.6. In the physical examination of the newborn, numerous petechiae on the head and trunk were observed. During the neonatal period, there were pneumonia, respiratory failure and thrombocytopenia. An episode of transient hypoglycaemia (12 mg/dL [normal range: 60?99 mg/dL]) occurred 16 h after delivery. On the third day of life, a CT scan of the abdomen and head was performed, and it led to the suspicion of a spleen injury and hypoxic and post-traumatic lesions of the brain (blood/haematoma on the surface of the cerebellar tentorium on the right side, and suspicion of indentation injuries to the skull bones). Moreover, a transfontanellar ultrasound showed calcifications along the course of the lenticulostriatal vessels. . At 8 months of age, a hearing test based on wave V yielded a bilateral threshold of 30 dBnHL at 2?4 kHz (mild hearing loss). Recurrent lower respiratory tract infections occurred throughout the first year of life, often presenting with shortness of breath and respiratory failure. A noticeable gross motor and fine motor delay was observed (she was able to roll over, but not yet able to achieve the ability to sit). Speech was absent. There was a significant delay in tooth eruption (first teeth at 12 months of age). From the age of 2 months onwards, seizure incidents of various morphologies without fever and episodes of unconsciousness were observed. A sleep EEG performed at the age of 2.5 months showed bifocal seizure activity, which led to the application of a phenobarbital treatment. No epileptic seizures were observed from the commencing of the medication administration up till the 13th month of life. Afterwards, several incidents of immobility with eye rotation and increased muscle tone were noted, and an epileptic episode with the morphology of limb tremor with eye rotation to the right and mouth open occurred. A sleep EEG performed at the age of 14 months showed background disorganization and epileptiform discharges. Seizures remained intractable despite treatment with antiepileptic drugs, such as lamotrigine and phenobarbital. A brain MRI examination performed at the age of 14 months revealed an absence of normal myelination according to the age of the child. The T1- and T2-weighted images suggested delayed myelination of the cerebral white matter. The MRI appearance indicated a stage of myelination that was typical for the age of 8 months as there was a pronounced difference between the ��anterior�� and ��posterior�� parts of the brain, which was visible on the T1-weighted image with a lower signal within the former one. However, cortex/white matter differentiation could be detected instead of being blurred, which is a typical finding of a normal myelination process, meaning that a dysmyelination disorder should be suspected in this child. There was also dilatation of the lateral ventricles, the third ventricle and the cerebral sulci as a sign of cerebral cortico-subcortical atrophy. The MRI also showed a cavum septum pellucidum, which is a normal variant of the CSF space, between the leaflets of the septum pellucidum. The patient was initially fed by a nasogastric tube with breast milk, then with a first infant formula. Abdominal pain and constipation suggested food allergy. After modifying the diet (hydrolysed whey protein) and pharmacological treatment (macrogol, trimebutine and omeprazole), a partial improvement was observed. At the age of 11 months, the patient was admitted to the gastroenterological ward due to feeding problems, such as food retraction, spitting up and gag reflex. The patient��s weight was 10.26 kg, with a length of 74 cm (weight-to-length ratio at 90?97th percentile). At 12 months of age, due to a gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as well as recurrent aspiration pneumonia, a Nissen fundoplication was performed and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was placed. Until now, the patient is under the care of the nutrition ward. Currently, she is fed through a gastrostomy with a liquid, high-calorie diet (hydrolysed whey protein). Due to orofacial disorders, neurologopedic rehabilitation was recommended. In the second year of life, a reduction in the incidence of lower respiratory tract infections was observed (pneumonia and bronchitis), although she suffered from purulent otitis three times during this period. A physical examination at the age of 22 months performed by a clinical geneticist revealed facial/skull dysmorphic features resembling Cornelia de Lange syndrome, such as small teeth, a consistently open mouth, a low hairline, prominent eyebrows, and increased hairiness on the lower legs, thighs and forearms.

Repeat brain MRI with and without contrast, completed at age 1 year 8 months, revealed abnormal bright T2 and FLAIR signal in the posterior half of the midbrain with extension to the quadrigeminal plate. The abnormal signal extended to the posterior portion of the pons, abutting the floor of the 4th ventricle. Small areas of increased T2 and FLAIR signal were seen in both cerebral peduncles at the level of the midbrain. MR spectroscopy showed a normal lactate peak on left basal ganglia at 4 years of age. Multiple other brain MRIs without contrast were normal (2 years 5 months, 4 years, and 11 years of age). Other past medical history includes a horseshoe kidney diagnosed incidentally. She was able to sit at 9 months and cruise at 12 months. She lost these skills slowly over time. She is currently in a wheelchair. She is nonverbal, but engages socially with facial expressions including a social smile. She can fix vision on objects and can follow some simple commands with hands. On the most recent exam, at age 17 years, the patient sits upright in a wheelchair, but has dystonic movements of her trunk. She has microcephaly and mild coarsening of features with thick eyebrows. The anterior hairline extends onto her forehead. She is able to move her head and has normal extraocular movements with intermittent strabismus. She has normal nose, mouth and ears. Chest exam is significant for kyphoscoliosis. Cardiovascular and respiratory exams are normal. Abdomen is not distended, with no hepatosplenomegaly. Her sexual development is Tanner stage V, normal female. Extremities are atrophic and with significant hypertonia, more evident on left side compared to right.

He presented at 6 weeks of age with prolonged focal motor seizures and reduced visual attentiveness. He initially developed left clonic leg jerks during wakefulness and sleep. This evolved to right or left limb involvement with impaired awareness or bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. His EEG at 2 months showed paroxysmal delta and frequent independent bilateral mid-central parietal spikes and sharp waves (right > left) and occasional right temporal spikes. His seizures initially responded partially to phenobarbital and levetiracetam, but he had seizures every 1 to 6 months. The longest seizure free period was 16 months, between 4 and 6 years. Seizures were often prolonged and/or occurred in cluster. Currently, he has been seizure free 5 months on phenobarbital, levetiracetam and clobazam. He did not tolerate topiramate. His EEG at 4 years revealed a slow dysrhythmic background with multifocal epileptiform discharges. He never progressed past the infantile level; however, there was no definite regression until 4 years 9 months when he was hospitalized for lethargy, irritability and focal motor status epilepticus.

Radiographic differential diagnoses included a hemangioma, an arteriovenous malformation, or an arteriovenous fistula. Hemodynamic irregularity and a notable focus of plum red discoloration over the vertex of the lesion further supported concerns for a high-flow vascular lesion. Permanent histologic analysis revealed lobular capillary proliferation within dense fibrous stroma with large irregular vessels. Immunohistochemical staining for Glut-1 staining was negative. No evidence of cataracts or nephropathy was noted during hospital stay or any of the postdischarge visits. Sutures were removed on postoperative day 21 with excellent wound healing.

Init_example_3,"The case of a 4-year-old female who presented to pediatric genetic specialists with congenital hypotonia, bilateral conductive hearing loss, hyperextensible joints, and “staring spells.” The individual experienced transient tachypnea postnatally and was admitted to the NICU for 7 days due to respiratory distress. The patient failed her 5-month hearing screening, leading to an evaluation by otolaryngology, which noted bilateral conductive hearing loss. At 10 months, the patient presented with mild hypotonia, hyperextensible joints, and isolated patellar hyperreflexia. She had relative macrocephaly (head circumference in 98th percentile) and frontal bossing. She, however, had started puree and Step 1 foods later than expected. At 16–17 months, she experienced frequent ear infections. She presented at 20 months with developmental delay and continued hypotonia. She experienced a leg length discrepancy and dragged her left foot, refusing to lift it. She required speech and physical therapy. The patient also slept in 3–5 hour stretches and woke frequently. At 22 months, she was experiencing right leg weakness that accompanied her turning her right foot in when walking, toe walking on her right side, and falling a lot. She continued to have macrocephaly with frontal bossing even after her fontanelles closed. At 2 years old, it was noted she had poor dexterity in her fingers, could run but tripped a lot, and continued to turn her foot in and drag it while walking. At this time, she began to have staring spells 1–2 times a week. At 3 years old, she began stuttering while speaking and experiencing unresponsiveness in the middle of conversations. The patient wore orthotics and a hip brace. Her speech development was delayed. Her parents have noticed she fatigues easily for her age and has a low attention span. She also experiences chronic constipation and passes stool two times a week. She has some feeding difficulty due to oropharyngeal dysphagia. She has one café au lait spot on her right buttock.",ATN1,0

She had a small head but did not show any disease-specific facial abnormalities. No other obvious external deformities were observed. Blood tests at the time of admission showed an elevated level of CK (4050 U/L) and hyperbilirubinemia (13.7 mg/dL [234.3 μmol/L]). On admission, head ultrasonography showed marked enlargement of the left ventricle and hyperintense areas in the bilateral thalamus, and a simple brain CT was performed on the same day, which showed bilateral ventricular enlargement with left-sided predominance, periventricular calcification, and ischemic changes. She developed anemia (Hb 9.1 g/dL) on Day 18 and was started on oral iron and subcutaneous erythropoietin. At present, she is 10 months old. Her elevated level of CK has improved, and there has been no sign of recurrence of jaundice or anemia requiring a red blood cell transfusion, but she has persistent intractable seizures and developed hypsarrhythmia shown on EEG at 6 months of age. She is still not cervically stable and is developmentally delayed. She had no obvious complications on echocardiography, abdominal ultrasound, or ophthalmologic examination.",COL4A1,0
PMID37932750,"She was born at 37 weeks gestation in a non-consanguineous union to parents of Asian descent, without any pregnancy or delivery complications. She has a healthy 12-year-old sister. She had an age-appropriate developmental trajectory in the first year of her life. She had an upper respiratory illness at 10 months age during a visit to China after which the parents noted that she slowed down in her motor developmental trajectory. Parents�� concern was deepened when they noticed an unsteady gait after she started walking at 16 months of age. She could walk and run but would appear unsteady, leading to occasional falls. Toe walking was noted at 2 years of age, in addition to a steppage gait. Around 3 years of age she had a viral illness, after which she was noted to be more unsteady, resulting in at least 2 falls per week. Parents reported they had no concerns about speech and language development, and she was able to answer questions and follow direction in English and Mandarin until age 3.5 years. At that point she stopped responding to her name and music, following verbal instructions, and speech began to regress. Family history was non-contributory. Her weight was at the 43rd and height at 29th percentile for age. Exam was notable for a cooperative child who was inconsistent following commands, with a limited verbal output for age. There was no note of scoliosis or joint hyperextensibility and the cardiac, pulmonary, gastrointestinal exams were normal. She recognized mother and was able to point to her nose inconsistently on command. Auditory exam demonstrated inconsistencies in hearing. Extraocular movements were full and there was no nystagmus. Fundus exam did not reveal any abnormalities. The rest of the cranial nerve exam was normal. Muscle bulk was typical for age and there was absence of muscle atrophy. She had mild tightness in bilateral heel cords but otherwise tone was normal in other areas. Strength examination was limited due to cooperation, but within the limitations she was noted to have difficulty with bilateral foot eversion (4-/5) and demonstrated good power in the rest of the muscles of the face, neck, trunk, upper and lower extremities. Deep tendon reflexes were absent at the ankles and knees bilaterally and were 1?+?at the other sites. She had normal coordination in her upper extremities but demonstrated a wide based, unstable and steppage quality when walking. Her Romberg��s testing was negative, suggesting that she had a form of sensory ataxia. An electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction study demonstrated absent upper (median, ulnar and radial) and lower extremity (superficial peroneal and medial plantar) sensory responses with sparing of the sural sensory response. There was a severe decrease in lower extremity compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes in the nerves of lower extremity (Peroneal and tibial) and mild decrease in the upper extremity (median and ulnar) with normal distal latency and conduction velocities. F wave was absent in the tibial nerve. EMG demonstrated a neurogenic pattern with increased duration of voluntary motor unit potentials in the tibialis anterior and the gastrocnemius muscles. Behavioral auditory evaluation of thresholds revealed profound loss. MRI of the spine (at age 4.5 years) was notable for subtle cauda equina enhancement. MRI of the brain (at age 4.5 years), internal auditory canals and cochleae was unremarkable. Creatine kinase, lactate, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies were all within normal limits.",TWNK,0

The initial fetal ultrasonography revealed abnormal long bones in both lower extremities, mild hydronephrosis with detached right renal pelvis, and varus in both feet. Thus, they received further detailed anomaly scan of the fetus. A detailed fetal examination revealed severe malformation of bones, including shortened spine and ribs, leading to a small chest, and the long bones of the fetal limbs are distinctly short and curved, especially the femur. The face of the fetus is seen with micrognathia and significant thickening of the neck fold of 1.3?cm (>6?mm). The amniotic fluid index is 21.7?cm, beyond the normal range of 14.3?15.9?cm.

PMID36657988,"A 2-month-old, ex-full term, developmentally appropriate girl presented with abnormal eye movements described as a transient forced downward gaze and exaggerated eyelid opening. The patient developed projectile vomiting with feeding. She remained afebrile but seemed fussier than usual. She was evaluated in an outside emergency department and discharged home. Within 24 hours, the abnormal eye movements started. Her parents described paroxysmal tonic downgaze of her eyes. This became more frequent and at the time of presentation was occurring approximately once every 30 minutes. On examination, her fontanelle was soft, and her neurologic examination was normal except for intermittent exaggerated eye opening. A limited rapid MRI brain that included only a T2 sequence was unrevealing. CSF studies were normal (cell count 0/uL, glucose 53 mg/dL, protein 19 mg/dL, meningitis PCR/culture negative). Metabolic screening laboratory results, including ammonia, acylcarnitine, plasma amino acids, l-carnitine, and urine organic acids, were normal. However, lactate was elevated at 4.9 mmol/L and remained elevated to 2.1 mmol/L on repeat testing. Twenty-four-hour video EEG monitoring showed a normal background and captured episodes of fussiness and tonic downgaze without electrographic correlate. Her spells and fussiness began to diminish spontaneously without a clear reason for resolution, but she was discharged home with a plan for further outpatient monitoring. We hypothesize that her emesis may have represented a transient viral infection contributing to fluctuating metabolic demand. Two days later, she developed extreme irritability and recurrence of the exaggerated eye opening and paroxysmal tonic downgaze. She then developed intermittent extension and flexion of the bilateral upper extremities as well. Her parents reported regression in visual tracking, loss of social smile, and head control. She was urgently readmitted to the hospital. Complete blood count illustrated a thrombocytosis of 669 �� 109/L, but other laboratory results, including a comprehensive metabolic panel, C-reactive protein, chromosomal microarray, urine homovanillic acid, and vanillylmandelic acid, were all normal. A peripheral venous lactate was repeated and was again elevated at 2.3 mmol/L. Forty-eight hours of video EEG remained normal including again capturing episodes of abnormal eye movements. Repeat complete brain MRI and MR spectroscopy was performed, revealing symmetric restricted diffusion in the bilateral lentiform nuclei and frontal lobes along the peri-Rolandic cortex. There was also abnormal signal within the bilateral thalami and cerebellar hemispheres, not present on the previous MRI. MR spectroscopy was notable for a reduction of NAA relative to other metabolites within the lentiform nucleus, suggesting neuronal injury. However, no lactate peak was noted, which can be suggestive of hypoxic injury or certain mitochondrial diseases, such as mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). No mineralization was noted on susceptibility weighted imaging, which can be seen in disorders such as neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation.",SLC19A3,0
PMID38223361,"Two-and-a-half-year-old Saudi girl with no significant past medical history presented to the emergency room with a 3-day history of frequent falls with an unsteady gait, tremors, slurred speech, and dysphagia with excessive drooling. On the 2 days of admission, the patient developed a lower-limb dystonic posture that severely limited her ability to walk and stand. There was no history of a decrease in the level of consciousness, seizure, or ophthalmoplegia. In the beginning, the mother denied any history of drug ingestion, trauma, recent infection, behavioral change, or neurodevelopmental regression, but after the toxicity test result, the mother mentioned that her daughter ingested around 20 mL of ethyl alcohol that is used in formulating perfumes 1 day before her presentation. According to the parents, the developmental milestone was uneventful and attained at the appropriate age. She was born to consanguineous parents, and she has an older brother who had a similar presentation, which was diagnosed as a case of BTBGD. A physical examination showed her to be alert, conscious (Glasgow coma scale 15/15), and vitally stable, with no meningeal signs. She speaks in full sentences with dysarthria. Her pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Her extraocular muscles are intact, and her face is symmetric. A neurological assessment revealed normal power and deep tendon reflexes, along with a bilateral plantar flexor response. With daily assessment, the tone increased in the legs, which maintained an extended posture with ankle inversion and plantar flexion. She supports herself on her legs but was unable to walk unassisted due to ataxia. The tremulousness of both upper extremities was noted. The initial laboratory test results revealed a normal complete blood count, renal and liver function tests, and a basic metabolic workup. After a few days of admission, a toxicity test result came back positive for ethyl alcohol (10 mg/dL). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral symmetrical areas of abnormal signal intensity, which was high on the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, T2 weighted image and restricted diffusion on the diffusion-weighted images and apparent diffusion coefficient noted in the basal ganglia in both putamen and caudate nuclei.

PMID38053933,"She was referred in the context of being previously very healthy, with no clinical concerns until 6 months prior to her appointment. Her pregnancy, delivery, neonatal, and early childhood histories were reviewed and were unremarkable for any notable clinical concerns. She was born following an uncomplicated pregnancy, at term, via repeat cesarean section. The delivery was uncomplicated, and her newborn screening was negative. Her past medical history was unremarkable for any overnight hospitalizations, concussions, seizures including febrile seizures, or intracranial infections. She had no history of developmental delays or regressions. She was a straight-A student. She was the product of a non-consanguineous union between healthy parents of Indian descent, with a healthy elder sibling and a healthy younger sibling. A review of her family history was negative for any concerns for developmental delays, significant childhood illnesses, early or unexplained deaths, neurological concerns, or known or suspected genetic diagnoses. She first came to medical attention when she presented to her primary care physician with symptoms of a lower respiratory tract infection and was diagnosed with pneumonia. She was treated with a 5-day course of oral antibiotics. On the 6th day of her illness, she had an episode of emesis after having breakfast. She had no associated abdominal pain, diarrhea, or headache. She went to school that day and was able to perform well, but noticed visual blurriness exacerbated by movement. She then developed a dizzy sensation towards the end of the school day. She had no syncope, altered level of consciousness, motor or sensory dysfunction of the limbs, or changes in speech pattern. The following day, her dizziness subsided, but she had increasing episodes of visual blurriness. These were particularly on the right side, and episodic, when she walked or read. She was able to complete her activities of daily living well, despite the blurriness. There was no associated visual loss or diplopia. These episodes ceased entirely after approximately 2 weeks. Following these, the patient noticed a heaviness of her eyelids nearing the end of the day, with an associated difficulty opening her eyes. She had no associated diplopia, bulbar or oro-motor symptoms, focal weakness, generalized weakness, or fatiguability. These symptoms also resolved after approximately 2 weeks. Along with the aforementioned symptoms, the patient had increased fatigue, difficulty focusing and concentrating at school, and a mild headache behind her eyes. She missed her morning classes during this period, as she felt she needed extra sleep. Following the cessation of the above-noted symptoms, she noticed the onset of restlessness in her legs when sitting for prolonged periods of time, and when trying to fall asleep. Associated with this, she had a painful heaviness or pressure from her thighs to the entirety of the soles of her feet, circumferentially. For the first 48 h after she first noticed these symptoms, she had paresthesia over the soles of her feet, at times up to the level of her knees bilaterally, more so on the right side than the left. She also had paresthesia over the entirety of the palmar aspect of her hands. The restlessness of her legs and the paresthesia improved after about a month. She reported no associated dysarthria, tremor, dystonia, encephalopathy, or cognitive regression. The imaging, performed approximately two months after her initial presentation at a community hospital, revealed bilateral, symmetric basal ganglia infarcts involving the caudate body, caudate head, and the anterior and posterior portions of the putamen. Little to no diffusion restriction was seen. It was felt that the basal ganglia infarcts appeared more subacute to chronic, versus acute, in nature. Upon her referral to a neurologist shortly after her MRI was done, she was found to have an unremarkable physical examination, with no focal motor or sensory deficits, no extrapyramidal signs, and no systemic symptoms or signs to suggest a specific etiology for her presentation. An extensive work-up was arranged, which was unremarkable. A repeat MRI brain was performed approximately one month after the initial study. There was, again, a note made of bilateral abnormal signal in the basal ganglia, predominantly involving the head and body of the caudate nuclei and putamen. Some central necrosis or cystic change was also noted. It was suspected that there was bilateral volume loss of the putamen. The differential diagnosis was felt to include metabolic etiologies (including mitochondrial disorders), toxic exposures, and remote injuries or insults, including previous infections that could predominantly affect the basal ganglia. She had difficulty with the recollection of names and explained that her difficulties with recall were making her homework take longer to complete. Despite these subjective deficits, the patient had no change in her overall academic performance, continuing to excel. The other symptoms she reported were that her writing was not as neat as it was prior to her illness and that it was more laborious than previously and sometimes painful. The patient was seen virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While this did not allow for a physical examination to be performed, her history of writing difficulties was felt to be suspicious for dystonia.",SLC19A3,0

The patient's convulsive episodes commenced at one and a half years of age, initially manifesting as simple febrile seizures. By the age of three, he began experiencing multiple GTCS episodes without associated fever. Following hospitalization, he was discharged on a regimen of phenytoin for a two-year duration. Despite this, he continued to experience one to two GTCS convulsive episodes monthly associated with postictal drowsiness lasting for 15-20 minutes. At five years of age, valproate and levetiracetam were introduced in addition to phenytoin. At eight years old, a new convulsive episode occurred during a febrile episode, prompting hospitalization. Carbamazepine and clobazam were added to the treatment regimen, alongside risperidone due to hyperactive behavior. During the latest admission, the patient received loading doses of injectable phenytoin, valproate, and levetiracetam, while maintaining previous medications. After stabilization, a neurologist recommended discontinuing carbamazepine and initiating lacosamide. During the latest admission, the patient received loading doses of injectable phenytoin, valproate, and levetiracetam, while maintaining previous medications. After stabilization, the pediatric neurologist recommended discontinuing carbamazepine and initiating lacosamide. A sleep-awake electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed ictogenic discharges in the right centro-temporal region. Given persistent hyperactive behavior, risperidone dosage was increased, and phenytoin was gradually tapered and discontinued. The patient was discharged with a plan to gradually wean off levetiracetam while maintaining valproate, risperidone, lacosamide, and clobazam. Post-seizure, the patient exhibited no postictal drowsiness, and physical examination revealed no facial dysmorphisms, with normal ophthalmic evaluations and vitals within the expected range.

She had a history of recurrent bronchitis since the age of 2 years. At the age of 6.7 years, she was diagnosed with an undifferentiated connective tissue disease, whose diagnostic workup revealed fulfilled classification criteria of SjS (SjS), though very early disease onset was not typical for primary SjS. This diagnosis was made on the basis of clinical findings, including bilateral keratoconjunctivitis sicca with positive Schirmer��s test, Raynaud��s phenomenon and cutaneous vasculitis, histopathological findings confirming vasculitic aetiology of mucosal ulcerations as well as laboratory findings and in particular, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia, hypocomplementeamia and antinuclear antibodies with positive Ro (SS-A) and La (SS-B) antibodies. All aforementioned treatments failed to control chronic ulcers, which led to a bilateral Syme��s amputation at the age of 11 years and 6 months, a transtibial amputation at the age of 14 years and repetitive wound debridement thereafter. At the age of 13 years, the patient presented with chronic diarrhoea and was diagnosed with colitis ulcerosa. Besides infected skin ulcers and surgical wounds, the patient displayed no discernible infections during her middle and late childhood. However, at the age of 19 years she was diagnosed with cytomegalovirus colitis that was attributed to the immunosuppressive effect of ciclosporin and prednisolone treatment. A CT scan of the lungs revealed bilateral basilar bronchiectasis, when she was 20 years old. At the age of 23 years, she displayed ascites and splenomegaly and was diagnosed with portal hypertension, whose aetiology remains unknown.

He had computed tomography of the abdomen done which showed an enlarged caudate lobe, otherwise normal liver, portal vein diameter of 1.7 cm and spleen of 20.9 cm. These findings were concerning for non-cirrhotic portal hypertension, and he was advised to get trans-jugular liver biopsy with portal pressure measurements which the patient is currently contemplating.",PEPD,1
PMID38304571,"A 6-year-old male with prolidase deficiency was diagnosed at the age of 3 years with multisystem involvement including oropharyngeal dysphagia requiring nasogastric tube placement for feeding during infancy, splenomegaly (found at the age of 3 years), oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis treated with methotrexate administered subcutaneously once weekly since the age of 5, recurrent pneumonia and thrombocytopenia. He was evaluated by the hepatology team at the age of 5 years for persistent elevation in transaminases since he was 2 years old. Prior to evaluation, he had extensive evaluation at an outside hospital and workup was unrevealing. During the visit, he complained of retching secondary to oropharyngeal dysphagia which has been present since he was an infant. He denied any other complaints. He continues to be on tube feeds but tolerates minimal solid food orally. Other than methotrexate, he is on pimecrolimus, clonidine, and hydroxyzine. There is no family history of liver disease or cirrhosis. His vital signs were normal, with BMI of 14.7 kg/m2 (25th percentile). His physical examination revealed hypertelorism, flat nasal bridge, submucosal cleft palate, abdominal exam revealed enlarged spleen palpable 2?3 cm below the costal margin.",PEPD,2
PMID38660576,"A 5-month-old infant with a history of maternal HIV infection and prophylactic zidovudine during delivery was referred for evaluation due to focal motor and/or dyscognitive seizures with an autonomic component. Born at 39-week gestation with a 9?10 APGAR score, the infant experienced seizures at 2 months characterized by rhythmic limb movements and loss of consciousness. At 6 months of age, the child (height of 61 cm, weight in the 75th?90th percentile, and head circumference in the 88th percentile) showed abnormal eye movements and inconsistent eye contact. Spontaneous movements appeared jerky and lacked fluidity, and axial hypotonia was observed. Reflexes were normal, but difficulties were noted in lifting the head and supporting weight while prone. Bilateral rolling to the side was not observed, and parachute reactions were absent. A MRI scan showed small hemosiderin deposits in some regions of the right hemisphere without indications of CSF obstruction. Serial EEG investigations revealed diffuse polyspikes, wave discharges, and epileptiform abnormalities during sleep. At 10 and 15 months, EEG displayed clusters of epileptic spasms with characteristic polyspike waves and subsequent slow wave activity. The patient did not experience a seizure-free ��honeymoon�� phase.",CDKL5,0
PMID36873640,"A 3-year-8-month-old boy was admitted to the hospital in January, 2022 with complaints of fever up to 39��C, runny nose, cough, reduced appetite, irritability. The first symptoms appeared 5 days before the admission. He was treated for an upper respiratory infection, received symptomatic and antibiotic therapy. His condition did not improve, leading to his hospitalization. The patient's history showed that he was the first child of non-consanguineous parents. His weight at birth was 3,080?g. Vaccinations were carried out according to the schedule. On the 11th day after the first measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination, the boy developed symptoms of measles (fever, rash), for which he was hospitalized. n September 2020, the boy had COVID-19 after a contact with sick family members. The course of the disease was mild, accompanied by a cough for several days. However, a few days after COVID-19, the mother noticed a rapid progressive deterioration of the child's vision, up to a complete blindness. The boy was examined for this complaint in several clinics and was diagnosed with retinopathy and secondary macular dystrophy of unknown origin. During a hospitalization in November 2020, additional tests to clarify the diagnosis revealed acute otitis media, candidiasis of the oral mucosa and an increase in the levels of liver enzymes: aspartate aminotransferase (AST) up to 228.6?U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) up to 566.5?U/L, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) up to 376.6?U/L. The levels of bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) were within normal limits. Leukocytosis of 15.7 109/L was detected, while other values of the complete blood count (CBC), including the level of platelets, as well as the coagulogram indexes were within normal limits. Tests were carried out to exclude viral hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, toxoplasmosis, rubella, and HIV infection. IgM and/or IgG antibodies to the indicated pathogens were negative, except antibodies to rubella (high titer of IgG to rubella antibodies), which could indicate that the patient had rubella or the presence of post-vaccination antibodies. Autoimmune hepatitis and oropharyngeal candidiasis were diagnosed as signs of APECED. The patient received azathioprine, oral glucocorticoids with a gradual dose reduction and subsequent withdrawal, antifungal therapy, calcium and vitamin D. On the background of treatment, the levels of liver enzymes have normalized. Glucocorticoids were discontinued and the patient continued azathioprine intake.  In admission to the hospital in January 2022, the patient's condition was estimated as moderate. His weight was 15?kg (z ?0.32), height 94?cm (z ?1.36). The child was irritable. Slight swellings on the face, cracks on the lips were observed. The throat was hyperemic. The heart rate was 130 beats per minute, respiratory rate - 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation - 96%?98%. Vesicular breathing was heard over the thorax. The liver protruded 2?cm from the edge of the right costal arch, the spleen was located along the edge of the left costal arch. Given the negative PCR test for COVID-19, an examination was conducted to identify other causes of hepatitis. Hepatitis B and C markers (HBsAg, anti HCV IgM) were negative. However, a high titer of IgM antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus (55.68) was observed with a normal IgG indicator to the Epstein-Barr virus, 3.66 (reference <9). On the 4th day after admission (9th day after the onset of symptoms), a positive serology result for ����VID-19 was obtained: IgM?+?IgA antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were positive (64.38; reference range 6?8); positive PCR test for COVID-19 was also obtained.

PMID38111786,"A 3-year-old White boy with a medical history of chronic thrush, recurrent pulmonary infections, and constipation was transferred to a tertiary-care pediatric hospital in the United States for hepatic dysfunction in the setting of hypoxia because of rhinovirus infection. The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit and evaluated by the gastroenterology and hepatology service. Initial vital signs were notable for a heart rate between 120 and 129 beats per minute with physical examination showing a drowsy but cooperative child of stated age with no evidence of jaundice, ascites, splenomegaly, or edema. Liver function tests on presentation showed an aspartate aminotransferase of 355 U/L, alanine aminotransferase of 301 U/L, and total bilirubin of 3.1 mg/dL. Additional laboratory evaluation showed positive anti-nuclear antibodies (titer: 1:80) with negative anti-liver-kidney microsomal and anti-smooth muscle antibodies. Hepatitis C serology was reactive; however, hepatitis C nucleic acid amplification was undetectable. A liver biopsy was performed, which showed chronic active hepatitis with 60% steatosis (predominately macrovesicular) and stage 3 fibrosis. ",AIRE,0
PMID37663274,"A man in his 30?s with trisomy 21, intellectual disability, autistic spectrum disorder, atrioventricular septal defect, and Eisenmenger syndrome visited our hospital because of diarrhea and poor oral intake. Although he was alert, he had hypotension (83/52?mmHg) and a low-percutaneous oxygen saturation of 70% with a 10?L/min O2 face mask; usually his oxygen saturation is between 85% and 90% in room air. Physical examination revealed icteric skin and conjunctiva, a dehydrated mouth, and clubbed fingers. He had petechiae on the chest, but no spontaneous bleeding was found. A Levine III/VI holosystolic murmur was heard on the third left sternal border. He admitted to our hospital, and the initial evaluation demonstrated megaloblastic anemia (hemoglobin, 9.8?g/dL; mean corpuscular volume, 129.4?fL); normal reticulocyte count (90.2?��?109/L); thrombocytopenia (52?��?109 /L); unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (total bilirubin, 4.3?mg/dL; direct bilirubin, 0.3?mg/dL); elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (1,755?U/L); and decreased serum haptoglobin (<100?mg/L). Before the present episode, he had polycythemia due to chronic cyanosis caused by uncorrected atrioventricular septal defect and Eisenmenger syndrome. The latest blood test was 8?months prior to the admission, and hemoglobin was 20.1?g/dL at that time. Therefore, 9.8?g/dL of hemoglobin represented the acute anemia. Although hemolysis was indicated, his reticulocyte count was 90,200?/��L and was not increased. His blood urea nitrogen was 37.1?mg/dL and serum creatinine was 1.29?mg/dL, showing acute kidney injury. We checked hemorrhage as a cause of anemia since he had thrombocytopenia, but no hemorrhage was detected. Although we initially suspected thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), we diagnosed his illness as pernicious anemia for the following reasons. First, the acute kidney injury was resolved by intravenous rehydration. Second, decreased serum vitamin B12 (107?pg/mL), and elevated serum total homocysteine (55.6?mmol/mL) were revealed. Third, the antiparietal cell antibody and intrinsic factor antibody were both positive. Fourth, his ADAMTS13 activity was 30%, whereas TTP is diagnosed when the activity is lower than 5%. Soon after reaching the diagnosis, methylcobalamin was supplemented intramuscularly. Since his optimal hemoglobin level was calculated to be 19?g/dL because his oxygen saturation was 85% in normal time, red blood cells were transfused. In addition to methylcobalamin, folic acid was also supplemented because his serum folate level was decreased (1.2?ng/mL). After decreasing to 10?��?109/L, the platelet count started to increase from the 5th hospital day. The anemia resolved gradually and the last red blood cell transfusion was on the 8th hospital day. On the 14th hospital day, supplementation of methylcobalamin and folic acid ceased because the patient's serum vitamin B12 and folate levels exceeded the upper normal limit. In the course of recovery, exacerbation of preexisting chronic pericarditis and decreased swallowing function emerged.",AIRE,0
PMID37020766,"A 12-year-old boy reported to the Department of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry with concerns regarding the irregular shape and decaying of teeth. The patient had previously been diagnosed with APECED (type 1 anti-IFN antibodies positive) syndrome 5 years back. The child was born to a consanguineous marriage of the 3rd degree. Pedigree analysis revealed six siblings and a history of two intrauterine deaths. While five siblings presented with normal development and growth, the youngest sibling, aged 8 years, was found to have symptoms similar to the index case. The patient had achieved milestones appropriate for his age; however, he had stopped attending school due to visual disturbances. The child was active, and no mental abnormality was detected. Growth analysis at the time of presentation revealed short stature with a height below the 3rd centile, normal weight, and a body mass index (BMI) of 17.2?kg/m using the BMI Quick Screening Tool. The patient's medical history included the onset of seizures at the age of 3.5 years, which could not be explained by the treating doctor at that time. Seizures were associated with tongue biting, urinary incontinence, and loss of consciousness, which lasted for 5 minutes. At the age of 7 years, the nature of seizures changed with stiffness of hands and feet, proceeded by a tingling sensation that was suggestive of tetany. This was also followed by deviation of the mouth to the right side. Similarly, around the age of 4 years, the child also presented with recurrent bilateral oral lesions and lesions on the nail, which began with the right thumb. The lesions were black in color and associated with pain and increased fragility. The patient also reported recurrent lesions over the penile region associated with papular eruptions, which worsened during the summers. The diagnosis of candidiasis was confirmed with potassium hydroxide smears. The patient's mother also reported the absence of major secondary sexual characteristics, such as the growth of pubic and axillary hair, growth spurt, and enlargement of the testis. The patient was eventually diagnosed with hypocalcemia secondary to hypoparathyroidism, CMC, along with bilateral cataract and medullary nephrocalcinosis.",AIRE,0
PMID36974230,"A 5-year-old female child with a history of consanguinity presented to the emergency room with a new-onset tonic-clonic seizure without fever or other symptoms, no neurologic deficits during evaluation, and no prior history of epilepsy. She was admitted to the hospital for a workup, where she was found to have an electrolytic imbalance composed of severe hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hyperphosphatemia. She was found to be underweight with a BMI of 11.7kg/m2 (below the third percentile). It was also noted that since the age of two, she had several consults due to mucocutaneous candidiasis that didn��t improve with antifungal treatment (Figure ?(Figure1),1), as well as frequent diarrhea episodes and dental problems, mostly cavities. The initial laboratory studies revealed a total calcium of 6.9 mg/dl (normal range: 8.8-10.8 mg/dl) and ionic calcium of 3 (normal range: 4.6-5.08 mg/dl). Her serum phosphate levels were elevated at 11.4 mg/dl (normal range: 3.2-5.8 mg/dl) and her parathormone (PTH) was extremely low at < 1.20 pg/ml (normal range: 1-13 pg/ml). She was diagnosed with primary hypoparathyroidism and began treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate and a parathormone analog. Further complementary tests revealed no data on adrenal insufficiency or other autoimmune endocrine diseases. However, the presence of anti-insulin, anti-thyroglobulin, and anti-microsomal antibodies was confirmed. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was obtained and reported as normal; therefore, her seizure was attributed to her calcium imbalance and no anticonvulsant treatment was given. Candida infection was confirmed by culture, and she was seen by an infectious disease specialist who prescribed a 12-week course of fluconazole. ",AIRE,0
