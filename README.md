# LLM-Gene-Prioritization
Assessing the Utility of Large Language Models for Phenotype-Driven Gene Prioritization in Rare Genetic Disorder Diagnosis

### Get started
- ```config.py```: You will need Replicate and OpenAI API keys to execute the experiments.
- ```requirements.txt```: You will need the OpenAI library to execute the experiments.
- ```hgnc_complete_set_2020-10-01.json```: You will need the HGNC gene symbol to parse the LLM response
- ```./data/input/free_text_pmid_input.csv```: free text individual phenotype-gene input.
- ```./data/input/hpo_input.zip```: HPO-based individual phenotype input including ```probe_info``` with diagnosed gene info.
- ```experiment_gpt.py```: Run experiements for GPT.
- ```experiment_llama2.py```: Run experiments for Llama2.
- ```./data/llm_response/gpt_response.zip```: GPT responses. Each file is one experiment. This is generated by ```experiment_gpt.py```
- ```./data/llm_response/llama2_response.zip```: GPT responses. Each file is one experiment. This is generated by ```experiment_llama2.py```
- ```evaluation.py```: Generate experiment-by-row evaluation based on LLM responses.
- ```./data/evaluation/gpt_eval_table.csv```: Evaluation for GPT responses. Each row is one experiment. This is generated by ```evaluation.py```.
- ```./data/evaluation/llama2_eval_table.csv```: Evaluation for Llama2 responses. Each row is one experiment. This is generated by ```evaluation.py```
- ```./notebook```: analysis for manuscript
